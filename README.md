If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

A [Restic](https://restic.net/) package for YunoHost (heavily inspired by [the Borg package](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/borg_ynh/)).

Restic is a backup tool that can make local and remote backups.
This package uses restic to make backups to a sFTP server.
The package does not handle local backups yet but you can work around that by using the local sftp server as target server (see my comment [here](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/sauvegarde-yunohost-avec-restic/10275/33)).


**Shipped version:** 0.16.2~ynh1
